  Memory Layer is an AI-powered memory management platform that transforms your information into an intelligent, searchable knowledge base. Unlike traditional storage, we understand context, extract relationships, and connect the dots between your memories.

## How It Works

When you store a memory, we automatically:
- **Analyze** content for sentiment, intent, and key topics
- **Extract** entities (people, places, concepts) and relationships
- **Create** vector embeddings for semantic search
- **Map** connections in a knowledge graph
